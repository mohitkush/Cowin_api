# Cowin_api
Small attempt to build a vaccine availability buzzer using cowin api
api.py conatains a small code (super fast) which checks for vaccine availability in the given list of pincodes.\
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies.\
just run the code and do your work. As soon as it detects the availability it will play a buzzer and open the login page, enter your details and vaccinate yourself :)
